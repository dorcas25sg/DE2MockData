Public repository containing mock data for DE Assessment, **Section 1**.

## Overview

This repository provides mock datasets designed to test and validate data engineering pipelines for the DE Assessment.

## Contents

The mock data includes:

1. **The original 2 files** from the [DE Assessment Repository](https://github.com/Andylam2963/DE2TechAssessment)
2. **Additional mocked files** to test file extensions validation and other edge cases
   - *For detailed specifications and implementation details, please refer to the actual submission in the private repository*
3. **Organized folder structure** with files split into 2 distinct sets:
   - Simulates multiple runs of data processing code
   - Allows testing beyond initial full load scenarios
   - Enables validation of incremental processing logic
